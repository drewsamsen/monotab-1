# The Why

**Different from typical user-lists apps**
Reason it _needs to be on a new tab_ is because most user-list apps out there:
Pocket, flipboard, etc tend to become graveyards of "set and forget". When our lists
aren't in front of us they are often are never revisited.

MonoTab is different in that it hijacks the new tab screen in Chrome. A screen
we all see many times each day. The goal is to create something worth of taking over this
prime real estate. It needs to have a remarkable ux â€” something users will enjoy interacting with.
