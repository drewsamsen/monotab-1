## WHY

**Not Set/Forget**
Reason it _needs to be on a new tab_ is because all these
lists: Pocket, flipboard, save for laters — we never get back to them. They aren't
in front of us and "out of sight out of mind" is a thing.

If it's on a the new tab which we each see many times each day — it needs to
look super nice. Something we want to interact with.

**Memory Savings**
Save your browser some memory of having all those pages open at once.
